Before IT, I successfully built a professional music career, working in various genres and ensembles from Pop/Rock/Jazz combos to National Symphony Orchestras.

My journey in the IT industry has begun in the role of Software Test Engineer. Testing Software was a perfect match for my natural drive for quality. For most of my years in testing, I've been performing automation testing using JavaScript language with a set of custom test environments and libraries.

Developing solutions for solving problems through coding was the most rewarding part of testing for me. So, after completing the <a href='https://generalassemb.ly/'>General Assembly</a> Full-Stack Software Engineering course, here I am as a Full-Stack Web Dev.
